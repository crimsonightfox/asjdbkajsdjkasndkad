                        <p id="comment2">The history of computer science began long before the modern discipline of computer science that emerged in the 20th century, and hinted at in the centuries prior. The progression, from mechanical inventions and mathematical theories towards the modern concepts and machines, formed a major academic field and the basis of a massive worldwide industry.
                            Early history The earliest known as tool for use in computation was the abacus, developed in period 2700 - 2300 BCE in Sumer.
                            The Sumerians' abacus consisted of a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sex ageism number system.
                            Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles [citation needed]. Abaci of a more modern design are still used as calculation tools today.
                            The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer. It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to c. 100 BCE. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical</p>
